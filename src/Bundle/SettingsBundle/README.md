Settings Bundle
===============

The Accard framework patient bundle provides system settings functionality along with a small web interface.

Accard
------

Modern medical patient repository implementation in PHP and Symfony2. See
[the project homepage](http://dag.med.upenn.edu) for more details.

Testing
-------

Accard uses [PHPSpec](http://phpspec.net) to facilitate BDD style development.
We do not include the tool in our development dependencies with
[Composer](http://getcomposer.org), in favor of a global install. To install
PHPSpec and run the bundle specifications:

```bash
$ composer global require 'phpspec/phpspec' '*'
$ composer install
$ phpsec run -f pretty
```
